COURSE DESCRIPTION  
 
Welcome to Introduction to Public Speaking SPCOM 223 (FALL 2023). This a workshop  course 
in the theory and practice of composition and delivery of presentations. The course  explores 
the art of speech design and delivery and the significance of meaning-making in public  
address. 
 
In a broad sense, the course pursues the primary objectives of the Department of  
Communication Arts: 
 to examine agency and implication 
 to support critical and creative competencies, and 
 to encourage a language and imagination for the public good . 
 
More specifically, over the course of the class, through composing and presenting FIVE 
speeches including TWO 90-second speeches as well as THREE longer, major speech 
assignments (solo, pair and group); attending lectures; and participating in group discussions; 
students will explore: 
 
 speech design 
 argument and persuasion 
 audience expectations and listening practices 
 public speaking scholarship 
 communication as meaning making 
 communication as power 
 bodily and vocal expressivity 
 active listening, and 
 theatrical tools that will help expand your voice and express using your whole body. 
 
Students who complete the course will be able to… 
 
 think critically about communicative norms and expectations that influence, enhance,  
and limit the inclusion of speakers and ways in which speakers can challenge  
communicative norms and expectations 
 analyse audience, purpose, and context in public environments 
 research, design, and present effective one- to five-minute presentations 
 assess the effectiveness of your own and your peers’ presentations considering theory  
on speech organization, argument, and delivery 
 recognize the power of language, the pull of persuasion and how to read audiences and  
their expectations, and 
 evaluate both your own and others’ speeches by recognizing relationships among, and  
the effects of, a speaker’s body, voice, audience, and speech design. SP COM 223 004 FALL 2023

COURSE MATERIALS  
 
You can find readings and other course materials on our LEARN site. Readings will be assigned  
throughout the FALL term. Articles and media are available on our LEARN site under  “Content” 
> “Readings”. Presentation sign-up will be overseen via online Discussion Threads. 
 
In-person speeches are recorded and uploaded to LEARN. These recordings are for educational 
purposes. You will be required to  sign and observe a “Video Viewing Agreement” which we will 
be going through the first week of class. 
 
 
METHOD OF INSTRUCTION  
 
1) In Person Lectures – students are to attend and contribute during our in-person 
lectures scheduled throughout the term.  
 
2) Video Class Summaries and Tutorials –  throughout the term the Instructor may 
post videos that provide detailed instructions, rubric explanations or other general 
information that may be deemed helpful. 
 
3) Discussions Via LEARN – Some discussion threads may be held on LEARN to provide 
opportunities for on-going engagement.  
 
 
HOW YOU ARE BEING EVALUATED  
 
There are three main areas that I am evaluating your progress through the class: IN-
PERSON SPEECHES (FOUR in total); RECORDED SPEECH  (ONE in total); WRITTEN 
ASSESSMENTS (TWO in total); and  PARTICIPATION (throughout the term). 
 
GRADING BREAKDOWN  
 
60% Major Speech Assignments 
 Speech 1 Investigation of Self (2.5 minutes; solo) 15% 
 Speech 2 The Age of Persuasive Debate (3.5 min per person; in pairs) 20% 
 Speech 3 Sell Us Social Innovation (4-5 min per person in groups of 3) 25% 
10% 90-Second Progymnasmata (2 speeches x 5% per speech) 
10% Persuasive Peer Evaluation (of The Age of Persuasive Debate ) 
5% Evaluation of Self (through the term)  
15% Participation – outlined further below but includes reading responses, participating 
in-class discussions + improvisation activities, active listening, and general collegiality.  SP COM 223 004 FALL 2023 
 SYLLABUS  P a g e | 4  
  
Each of the FIVE speeches will have their own RUBRIC which I will provide leading up to the speech. 
In general, your evaluation focuses on various speech competencies we will  discuss over the 
term including, Voice, Embodiment, Audience (connecting with/centering), and Speech Design.  
 
A written copy of your script for your three MAJOR SPEECH ASSIGNMENTS is due on the day of 
your speech, uploaded to LEARN. For partner and group work: each student will submit a copy 
of your script.  In addition to the script for your final MAJOR SPEECH each student will also 
upload your specific power point slides that you created for the presentation.  
 
 
THE FIVE SPEECH PRESENTATIONS 
 
90-SECOND PROGYMNASMATA  
 
You will present two (2) Progymnasmata exercises as 90-second speeches. One will be 
delivered in person and the second will be recorded as an audio story and uploaded to LEARN. 
These are solo speeches that provide students with low-stress opportunities  to practice your 
delivery, scriptwriting, engagement styles, and various concepts. 
 
5% The focus of the FIRST Progymnasmata , or “bite-size” speeches, is on describing,  
explaining, and analyzing a MAXIM. A Maxim is a short statement expressing a general  
truth or memorable guide for living; for example, “the early bird gets the worm” or  
“actions speak louder than words” or the African Proverb, "he who runs after good  
fortune runs away from peace". 
 
You can choose any MAXIM, more than one student can use the same one, and it can  
come from any culture or place in the world. 
 
PRESENT September 18 + 20  
 
5% The focus of your SECOND Progymnasmata is to create a descriptive speech about 
anything you'd like. Your goal is to create an accurate mental picture in the mind of the  
audience regarding a specific person, place, or thing. Use your senses to help you write  
this descriptive speech. What do you see? What do you hear? What are you feeling? 
Remember, SHOW don’t TELL.

 SYLLABUS  P a g e | 5  
  
MAJOR SPEECH ASSIGNMENTS  
 
15% Speech 1 Investigation of Self 2:30 minutes per person  
For this assignment, you will design, rehearse, and deliver a two and a half-minute  
EXTEMPORANEOUS speech in which you inform your audience about your own experience 
with language, culture, identity, and/or meaning making. You might talk, for instance, about 
what subjects raised in the readings (Samboo, Tam) and viewings (Lyiscott, Leung) meant to 
you as you reflected on them OR how you experienced language in your home, school, 
sports team, or other setting, OR  language’s influence on your sense of identity and/or 
culture. 
 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE though you will be speaking about yourself in this speech, you must  
make the content meaningful—new, useful, relevant, interesting—to your audience of  
classmates and instructor by finding moments to  cent re your audi enc e. 
 
  You will lose 5% for every 30 seconds you go beyond 3 minutes or under 2:30. 
 
Sample Topics: 
Growing up between cultures 
The language and culture of hockey  
Communicating as a person with anxiety 
 
PRESENT October 2 and 4  
 
 
20% Speech 2 The Age of Persuasive Debates 3 minutes per person  
Your 2nd Major Speech Assignment, the Power of Persuasion (in pairs) is your opportunity to  
try and persuade or inspire us to see your perspective on a given topic. 
 
Working with another student in the class (of your choosing) you will craft a 3-minute speech  
(making for a 6-minute speech altogether) each sharing your perspective on the topic. 
 
Class time will be spent in topic generation. Topics can range from serious aspects such as 
campus safety should be improved OR course workload is too much OR sports gambling destroys 
people OR less serious topics like Jordan vs. Lebron OR Apple Music vs. Spotify. 
 
It is important to note the most important person/group to persuade is your audience not your 
partner. 
 
You will lose 5% if longer than 6 and a half minutes and will be cut off at the 7-minute mark, you will 
lose an additional 5% for being cut off; you will also lose 5% if it is under 6 minutes.  
 
PRESENT October 30 and November 1  SP COM 223 004 FALL 2023 
 SYLLABUS  P a g e | 6  
  
25% Speech 3 Sell Us Social Innovation (In groups of three) 12 minutes in total   
Take an important issue society is currently working through (or should be) and provide an idea  
for how we can solve it. Examples include clean drinking water for Indigenous communities,  
reducing plastic waste or carbon emissions,  etc. JUST NOT FAST FASHION! Your solutions can 
be your own ideas or inventions or something that already exists. 
 
Your individual component of the speech should be between 4 minutes long and include  the 
following key elements: 
 
 Each student should have at least THREE visual aids supporting your point 
 Each student provides at least two (2) moments that centre your audience 
 Each student provides a call-to-action AKA, the moment towards the end where you  
encourage the audience to stop watching the video and go out and make some change  
happen 
 
This is a GROUP exercise of THREE STUDENTS. I can help put your group  together.  In some 
special circumstances this can be a pairing or a group of four. The max/min times will adjust accordingly. 
 
For a group of three, the entire presentation should be no longer than 12 minutes total. A group 
of three will lose 5% for each minute beyond the 12-minute mark or each minute below the 12-minute 
mark. A group of three will cut off at the 15 minute mark and will lose an additional 5% for being cut off. 
 
 
Those who offer to present on November 22 will receive a bonus mark, meaning if you get 
21/25 = 84% you would then get 22/25 = 88%

WRITTEN ASSESSMENTS  
 
PERSUASIVE PEER EVALUATION (of The Age of Persuasive Debates ) 
10% Analyze both speakers from at least one persuasive debate and submit a 500-word analysis of 
the text, delivery, and persuasive attributes. Please include the names of those individuals in 
the debate you are evaluating  and what their topic is. Provide at least FIVE POINTS per 
speaker using constructive analysis we  have used in class. This will help build your case for 
answering questions like who succeeded and how someone can strengthen their argument, 
and how they connect with you. Be specific with your points.  
 
DUE November 17  
 
SELF-REFLECTIVE ASSESSMENT  
5% The self-evaluation is an opportunity to review your speeches from the beginning of  
term and reflect on what you may have found challenging about creating speeches and  
what has come easily. You can discuss what you enjoy about speeches and what might  
still intimidate you. 500 words minimum. Focus on at least two of your speeches and  
articulate what you hope to keep working on. Please reference at least one reading that  
resonated with you (i.e., Ancient Rhetoric, Persuasive Speeches, Mother Tongue, etc)  
and one of the videos we watched. I would also like you to include a point about  
something that resonated with you over the term from one of my lectures (so  please 
attend at least a couple). 
 
DUE December 5  
 
Some GENERAL INFORMATION about these evaluations: 
 
1) Submissions for these written assignments via DROPBOX on LEARN.

PARTICIPATION – READING RESPONSE, DISCUSSION THREADS and VIDEO FEEDBACK  
 
15% Participation mark reflects how you are engaging with the material and contributing to 
the development of your classmates. Your participation mark is comprised of four key 
facets: Reading Responses, Introduce Us!, digital feedback on Progym 2, and overall 
class engagement. 
 
Reading Responses – when assigned readings/media, you submit a reflection usually 
consisting of two quotations from the assigned text along with short  notes explaining 
your reason for choosing the quotes; followed by one question about  the 
reading/media. You submit these to the Dropbox by the assigned date. 
 
These are each worth 1% towards your PARTICIPATION mark. Simply put, submit on  
time = 1%! ** You only need to cite external resources rather than citing the course  
text. When applicable, please include page number where you found the quote. 
 
Introduce Us! is pretty much as advertised! Let’s get to know each other! We’ll go 
around and introduce ourselves with info like: What is your name? Where are you  from 
- Mississauga? New York? India? What is your major? Why are you taking  SPCOM? What 
are you hoping to learn or gain from it? What is one thing you like to do  in your spare 
time, gardening? Building robots? Playing video games – what’s your  favorite?  
 
Digital Feedback You have the opportunity to gain up to 2 participation marks by 
providing online constructive, detailed feedback for up to six of your classmates for 
Progym #2.  
 
Class Engagement consists of three major areas: 1) general engagement with the 
material and offering thoughtful dialogue during class; 2) providing valuable feedback for 
your classmates in how they succeeded in their speeches or where they can strengthen 
their approach - our goal with feedback both in person and digitally, is to get specific, 
beyond simply, “I liked it”; 3) engagement with the improvisation exercises throughout 
the term.  
 
Professionalism  isn’t a mark you gain participation marks however can be a place 
where you lose them. A couple examples include not listening to your classmates and 
interrupting them when talking; watching non-SPCOM related videos during class; 
obviously taking Instagram photos in the middle of speeches; or not responding to 
classmates in group activities; spotty attendance (i.e., missing presentation without 
communicating; missing more than 4 classes without communicating) is included in 
this areaSP COM 223 004 FALL 2023

SPEECH PREPARATION  
Almost all speeches undergo extensive revision, and almost all speechmakers practice and hone  their 
skills regularly. For this reason, you should prepare to write outlines of your speeches and  workshop 
your speeches with your groups as well as friends and family. Each major speech  should undergo 
revision at least once and spoken at least four times before you present it.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  
All students are expected to follow the policy of academic integrity as a participating member  
of Waterloo’s academic community. All speeches should be written in your own words, and 
quotations and ideas should be cited with author’s name and additional information that would  
enable others to locate the source. Students who violate these rules will be subject to the  
academic regulations of the University. Plagiarism in any form will be penalized to the full extent 
per University Policy. OPEN AI is a tool you can use to help with building your speeches but you 
should still have the writing be in your own voice.

GRADING STANDARDS AS PER THE UNIVERSITY  
 
A (80-100%)  
Exceeds assignment guidelines; strong and consistently applied definition of audience and  
purpose; thoughtful and innovative adaptation of the subject to the audience’s needs; subject  
developed and organized at every level for listener comprehension; speaker uses language  
appropriately, effectively and even inventively; maintains relaxed, inviting delivery free of  
verbal fillers and distractions; cites sources appropriately both in spoken and written work;  
submits well-prepared required materials. 
 
B (70-79%)  
Meets assignment guidelines well; purpose and audience clearly defined; format consistently  
appropriate to audience and subject; subject supported with specifics as well as generalities;  
speaker maintains an economy of expression; information provided is sufficient to audience  
needs and coherently explained; speaker makes appropriate word choices. Citations clearly  
stated both on the outline and during delivery; speaker submits all required materials. Delivery  
may demonstrate signs of nervousness (pace, reading, etc.) but not sufficiently to interfere with  
the audience’s comprehension. Minor revisions required. 
 
C (60-69%)  
Meets assignment guidelines; adequate use of format, organization, and content to meet  
audience needs; speaker demonstrates some problems with audience adaptation, content,  
organization, or format, but not to the extent that the presentation fails to meet minimal  
expectations. Citations adequately present; submitted materials may be poorly prepared.  
Delivery awkward in several categories, but again—meets minimal expectations. Considerable  
revision required. 
 
D (50-59%)  
Does not meet important requirements of the assignment; inadequate use of format; poor  
development of subject for audience needs; inadequate awareness of audience and/or  
purpose; problems with organization, content, logic, research and citations; ineffective use of  
language; delivery sufficiently poor to impede reception of presentation. Required materials  
poorly prepared or absent. Serious revision required. 
 
 
F (0-49%)  
Fails to meet most of stated assignment requirements: lack of focus on a subject; unsatisfactory  
format; lack of audience awareness and/or purpose; inadequate content poorly developed; lack  
of logical connection between parts of presentation and/or ideas; ineffective and/or careless  
use of language; absence of prepared materials. While delivery may be adequate, revision is  
pointless: speaker should start a new assignment, take the course more seriously, or drop the  
course. SP COM 223 004 FALL 2023
